# Lemonade Game Compatibility List

Anyone is free to update or share their results here, with the following requirements:
- You **must** use an official release with any hacks disabled. All mods & cheats of any kind must also be disabled.
- Follow the new issue template and remove any unnecessary text, but **please leave all formatting intact**.
- Search for a game first before adding a new issue; if you find an existing issue that is out of date, reply to it with a copied/pasted new issue template. A curator will then edit the OP with your test data.

This repository is only for documenting the status of various games. For more technical issues, please use the issues tab in the [main Lemonade repo](https://github.com/Lemonade-emu/Lemonade/).

When you update or add additional information in an issue, please reply to the issue indicating your changes.

**Status label cheat sheet**:
- `status-perfect`: - Game runs perfectly
- `status-playable` - Boots and plays without any crashes or significant bugs, and at a speed fast enough to reasonably enjoy on an average PC. 
- `status-ingame` - Boots and goes in-game but suffers from one or more of the following: crashes, deadlocks, gpu bugs, distractingly bad audio, or is simply too slow. Game still might able to be played all the way through, but not as the game is intended to play.
- `status-menus` - Boots and goes past the title screen but does not make it into main gameplay.
- `status-intro` - Boots but only gets to the intro.
- `status-broken` - Does not boot/show signs of life.
